# OLIO

This repository is an exercise in data organization, representation and theory. In particular, this repository concerns a novel data format/protocol called Olio, which is itself conceptually a subpart of a larger exercise in data organization, representation, and theory called "Basic Data Organization Protocol" (BDOP).

Olio is not only a work-in-progress, but also might be completely unnecessary and/or unworkable. It draws inspiration from JSON, BSON, Markdown, XML, HTML, Bear and maybe just about anything else. Hopefully, it is at least aptly named.
